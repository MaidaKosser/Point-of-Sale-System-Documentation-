# 💳 Point-of-Sale System (Documentation)

> A fully functional Point of Sale (POS) System designed to streamline sales operations for small-scale businesses such as retail shops, grocery stores, and service-based outlets.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and document a **Point-of-Sale System** that efficiently handles retail transactions, including billing, inventory management, and customer handling, making it easier for small business owners to manage daily sales.

This POS project aims to:

- Demonstrate key software engineering principles (analysis, design, documentation)
- Simulate real-time sales, inventory, and receipt generation
- Serve as a foundational POS solution for future upgrades and GUI/web integrations

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **Java / C++ / Python** (depending on your codebase)
- **Console I/O / GUI (if applicable)**
- **UML Diagrams** – for class and activity flows
- **SRS Document** – for system requirement specification
- **Use Case Descriptions**
- **Sequence Diagrams**
- **ER Diagrams** – for data relationships
- **Figma** – for UI/UX prototype design

## 🧠 Figma Prototype

We designed a visual prototype of the POS system using Figma to simulate user interaction and flow between screens.
